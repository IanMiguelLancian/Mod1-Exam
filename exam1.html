    it is good to check the details of this place, just like the gorgeous Ngo Mon Gate, The Thai Hoa Palace with its finely interior detail,

  <p>For all of you beach lovers, this is the nicest beach to go to. Nha Trang is 6 kilometers long and a well maintained beach. It is just along the shoreline of Nha Trang
    City. Foreign tourist goes to this beach, especially every summer where this beach will be jam-packed with all the people. In this beach, you can swim with the designated
    swimming areas and also manicure lounge along the area which is really great if you plan to have a relax/chill day. There are also places you can visit if ever you are done
    staying on the beach, just like the ancient Po Nagar Cham Towers which is used as a place to worship since the 7th century and the museum that is dedicated to Alexandre Yersin.

    trading center of the 15th century. It is also a place where Japanese and Chinese sellers gather and sell silks. Hoi An's trademark is the 
    delightful Japanese bridge located at western end of Tran Phu street. We can also see the assembly hall of the Fujian Chinese Congregation which
    is also the town's old most decorated temple. There are still many Pagodas and museums dotted about the town, but Hoi An' charm is the lively streets
